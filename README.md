# HackBU - Discord Bots Workshop

## Getting Started

In this workshop, you will learn how to create your very own Discord Bot that you can use to help you manage your Discord servers, create custom commands, and add functionality to your servers. 

This workshop will go over the full process of making a Bot, from grabbing an API key to actually making and testing our Bot's functionality. 

Today's workshop covers:

1. An introduction to Discord Bots
2. [Creating a Discord Bot](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/DiscordBotWorkshop/blob/main/CreatingBot.md)
3. [Coding a Discord Bot](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/DiscordBotWorkshop/blob/main/CodingBot.md)

We also have an optional (but very interesting!) section on Concurrency that we recommend you take a look at.
